Adaptable: All static nodes (sink also) change Imin from the beggining
Dynamic: Control Mechanism. All statics change Imin at second 30
Default: Nothing changes

fullScript-Idouble-Change : Plays with Idouble ONLY
fullScript-various-Periods: plays with Period AND Idouble
Note: Imin is not part of this since it is different for statics/mobile nodes

File fullScript-various-Periods-ONLY-4-RECREATE has comments on ALL Executables.
It only needs:
1. Input folder (iL*)
2. periods of both mobile & static nodes
It will create all graphs and folders
Good for testing
