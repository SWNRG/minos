Changed the area of coverage for 30meters
Monroe nodes stay at the very small same area of the map...


Adaptable: All static nodes (sink also) change Imin from the beggining
Dynamic: Control Mechanism. All statics change Imin at second 30
Default: Nothing changes

fullScript-Idouble-Change : Plays with Idouble ONLY
fullScript-various-Periods: plays with Period AND Idouble
Note: Imin is not part of this since it is different for statics/mobile nodes
