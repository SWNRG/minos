# MINOS DASHBOARD - GUI
The MINOS platform is designed to interact with the user through a highly flexible GUI, implemented in the Node-RED platform (https://nodered.org/).

The GUI allows the operator to select the protocol and its corresponding parameters manually; then the visualization outcome varies according to the protocol deployed.

The dashboard performs the overall monitoring while providing advanced functionality and configuration options.
